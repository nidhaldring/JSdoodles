so i was trying to implement the infamous 2048 game using p5.js but since i didn't know how the game worked entirely
i ended up creating an edited hacky (and ugly) version of the game  but i kept it !
( cuz the code seemed so wonderfull and neat xD ) <br/>
: i leave it for you to find the difference :3

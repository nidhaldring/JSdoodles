So i was trying to implement the infamous 2048 game using p5.js but since i didn't know how the game worked entirely
i ended up creating an edited <b>hacky</b> (and ugly) version of the game  but i kept it !
( cuz the code seemed so wonderfull and neat xD ) <br/>
<b>I'm leaving as an exercise to reader to find the difference  </b>

<br/>
